"""OpenUSCT: full waveform inversion for ring-array ultrasound tomography.

A compact, dependency-light research framework for reconstructing the sound
speed of a cylindrical specimen from full-matrix-capture data recorded on a
ring transducer array. The forward model is a 2D acoustic finite-difference
solver; the inverse solver is adjoint-state full waveform inversion.

(``ringfwi`` is the import package name; OpenUSCT is the project.)
